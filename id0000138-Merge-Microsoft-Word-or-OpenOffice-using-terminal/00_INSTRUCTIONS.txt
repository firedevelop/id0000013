Download and install ooopy, from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ooopy/

unzip de folder, go inside, and type in terminal:
sudo python setup.py install

If you are a Mac user, you cannot install ooopy, because this libray need create a folder called "share" into the path:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/
To fix this issue, simple you need disable the "System Integrity Protection" (check how to do in internet is easy using the command csrutil disable), after install ooopy you can enable again
